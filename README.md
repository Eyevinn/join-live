## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Or build and run manually:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t join-live .
   docker run -p 3000:3000 join-live
   ```

3. **With custom gateway URLs:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 \
     -e WHIP_GATEWAY_URL=your-whip-gateway \
     -e WHEP_GATEWAY_URL=your-whep-gateway \
     -e WHIP_AUTH_KEY=your-whip-auth-key \
     join-live
   ```

### Using Node.js directly

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Application Views

- **Participant View** (`/join`): Camera access and live streaming
- **Editor View** (`/editor`): Stream management with numbered mosaic and keyboard shortcuts
- **OBS Browser Source** (`/source`): Clean video output for OBS Studio Browser Source
- **QR Code Display** (`/qr`): QR code for participant joining, ideal for OBS Browser Source

### Using the Application

1. **Join as Participant:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/join`
   - Click "Start Camera" to preview your video
   - Click "Join Live" to start broadcasting
   - Click "Stop Streaming" to end the broadcast

2. **Editor Interface:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/editor`
   - View numbered mosaic of all active streams
   - Press number keys `1-9` (and `0` for 10th stream) to select streams
   - Selected stream is synchronized across all devices

3. **OBS Integration:**
   
   **For Video Output:**
   - Use **Screen Capture** (or **Window Capture**) in OBS to capture the participant's video feed
   - The selected participant's video will be displayed full-screen based on editor selection
   - Alternatively, add `http://localhost:3000/source` as **Browser Source** for a clean output
   
   **For QR Code Display:**
   - Add `http://localhost:3000/qr` as **Browser Source** in OBS
   - QR code will display the join URL for participants to scan and join

## Configuration

### WHIP Gateway URL

To configure a WHIP gateway, provide the base URL (the `/api/v2/whip/sfu-broadcaster` endpoint path is added automatically):

**Option 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
WHIP_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-whip-gateway.com npm start
```

**Option 2: .env file**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your WHIP_GATEWAY_URL (base URL only)
```

### WHEP Gateway URL

The application uses WHEP (WebRTC-HTTP Egress Protocol) for viewing streams in the editor and OBS source. By default, it uses the same gateway as WHIP, but you can configure a separate WHEP gateway:

**Option 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
WHEP_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-whep-gateway.com npm start
```

**Option 2: .env file**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your WHEP_GATEWAY_URL (base URL only)
```

### WHIP Authentication

If your WHIP gateway requires authentication, set the auth key:

**Option 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
WHIP_AUTH_KEY=your-auth-key npm start
```

**Option 2: .env file**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your WHIP_AUTH_KEY
```

**Combined Example:**
```bash
WHIP_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-whip-gateway.com \
WHEP_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-whep-gateway.com \
WHIP_AUTH_KEY=secret123 \
npm start
```

### Port Configuration

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start  # Run on port 8080 instead of 3000
```

## Docker Scripts

Available npm scripts for Docker:

```bash
npm run docker:build           # Build Docker image
npm run docker:run             # Run Docker container
npm run docker:run-dev         # Run with development environment
npm run docker:compose         # Start with docker-compose
npm run docker:compose-build   # Build and start with docker-compose
npm run docker:compose-down    # Stop docker-compose services
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **@eyevinn/whip-web-client**: Open source WHIP client library
- **express**: Web server for serving the application

### WebRTC Configuration

The application requests camera and microphone access with these settings:
- Video: 1280x720 resolution (ideal)
- Audio: Default microphone
- Camera: Front-facing (user) camera preferred

### WHIP Integration

Uses the Symphony Media Bridge WHIP gateway for ingesting WebRTC streams. The application automatically appends `/api/v2/whip/sfu-broadcaster` to the base gateway URL.

## Browser Support

- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 84+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Access Issues
- Ensure you're accessing the app via HTTPS in production
- Check browser permissions for camera/microphone access
- Some browsers require user interaction before requesting media access

### Connection Issues
- Verify the WHIP/WHEP gateway URLs are correct and accessible
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- Ensure the WHIP/WHEP gateways support the required WebRTC codecs
- Verify authentication keys are correct for the WHIP gateway

### Development
For development with HTTPS (required for camera access on remote devices):
```bash
# Use a tool like ngrok for HTTPS tunneling
npx ngrok http 3000
```
