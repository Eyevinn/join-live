## Configuration

### WHIP Gateway URL

To configure a WHIP gateway, provide the base URL (the `/api/v2/whip/sfu-broadcaster` endpoint path is added automatically):

**Option 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
WHIP_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-whip-gateway.com npm start
```

**Option 2: .env file**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your WHIP_GATEWAY_URL (base URL only)
```

### WHEP Gateway URL

The application uses WHEP (WebRTC-HTTP Egress Protocol) for viewing streams in the editor and OBS source. By default, it uses the same gateway as WHIP, but you can configure a separate WHEP gateway:

**Option 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
WHEP_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-whep-gateway.com npm start
```

**Option 2: .env file**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your WHEP_GATEWAY_URL (base URL only)
```

### WHIP Authentication

If your WHIP gateway requires authentication, set the auth key:

**Option 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
WHIP_AUTH_KEY=your-auth-key npm start
```

**Option 2: .env file**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your WHIP_AUTH_KEY
```

**Combined Example:**
```bash
WHIP_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-whip-gateway.com \
WHEP_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-whep-gateway.com \
WHIP_AUTH_KEY=secret123 \
npm start
```

### Port Configuration

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start  # Run on port 8080 instead of 3000
```

## Docker Scripts

Available npm scripts for Docker:

```bash
npm run docker:build           # Build Docker image
npm run docker:run             # Run Docker container
npm run docker:run-dev         # Run with development environment
npm run docker:compose         # Start with docker-compose
npm run docker:compose-build   # Build and start with docker-compose
npm run docker:compose-down    # Stop docker-compose services
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- **@eyevinn/whip-web-client**: Open source WHIP client library
- **express**: Web server for serving the application

### WebRTC Configuration

The application requests camera and microphone access with these settings:
- Video: 1280x720 resolution (ideal)
- Audio: Default microphone
- Camera: Front-facing (user) camera preferred

### WHIP Integration

Uses the Symphony Media Bridge WHIP gateway for ingesting WebRTC streams. The application automatically appends `/api/v2/whip/sfu-broadcaster` to the base gateway URL.

## Browser Support

- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 84+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Access Issues
- Ensure you're accessing the app via HTTPS in production
- Check browser permissions for camera/microphone access
- Some browsers require user interaction before requesting media access

### Connection Issues
- Verify the WHIP/WHEP gateway URLs are correct and accessible
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- Ensure the WHIP/WHEP gateways support the required WebRTC codecs
- Verify authentication keys are correct for the WHIP gateway

### Development
For development with HTTPS (required for camera access on remote devices):
```bash
# Use a tool like ngrok for HTTPS tunneling
npx ngrok http 3000
```
